# Solar Panel Analysis
 

## Background and Overview
As part of our ongoing efforts to optimize renewable energy output, our team conducted an in-depth analysis of solar panel generation and weather sensor data collected from two solar farms in India. Over a 34-day period, data was recorded at 15-minute intervals to capture detailed operational metrics.

### Data Collection & Structure:

    Power Generation Data:
    Data is collected at the inverter level, where each inverter monitors multiple strings of solar panels. This granular approach allows us to assess the performance of individual inverters and identify any discrepancies or areas for maintenance.

    Weather Sensor Data:
    Weather measurements are captured at the plant level via a single, strategically placed array of sensors. This setup provides an overview of environmental conditions impacting the entire solar farm, ensuring that our energy generation forecasts account for real-time weather variations.

By integrating these datasets, we can develop robust models to predict future power output, identify efficiency trends, and ultimately enhance our operational strategies.

## Executive Summary


## Project Goals
Analysis aims to achieve the following objectives:
1. Forecast Future Power Generation
    - Develop accurate predictive models to forecast solar power generation for the next few days.
    - This will support imporved gird management and energy distribution planning.
2. Optimize Maintence Scheduling:
    - Detect performane patterns that indicate when panels may require cleaning or routine maintenance, ensuring that overall effiency is maintained and downtime is minimized.
3. Identifying Faulty of Underperforming Panels:
    - Analyze the dat to pinpoint panels that are malfunctioning or underperforming, enabling targeted interventions to enhance system reliablity and energy output.
